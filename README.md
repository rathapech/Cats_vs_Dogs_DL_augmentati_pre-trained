# Cats_vs_Dogs_DL_augmentation_pre-train
In this study, we aim at classifying two classes of images of cats and dogs respectively by using limited data. There are 1000 images of each class and there are 400 images for validation. In total, we have 2000 training data and 800 validating data. It is commonly believed that deep learning works well with large amount of training data especially in image classification. It is not completely wrong. In this study, we will train the deep learning classifier with limited data and try to improve the performance by using two techniques, namely data augmentation and pre-trained network.
